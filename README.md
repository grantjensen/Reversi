This code generates a neural net bot to play 8x8 Othello against. Basic structure is inspired by AlphaZero by DeepMind. Use agent.py to train models, config.py to adjust settings. Note that the models were trained via a VM instance on Google Cloud Platform due to the high run time of model generation.

Techniques used:
Monte Carlo Tree Search, Convolutional Neural Network, Cloud Training
